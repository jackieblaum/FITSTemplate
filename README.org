** Dependencies
- Python 2.7
- [[http://www.astropy.org][AstroPy]]
- [[http://www.numpy.org][NumPy]]
- [[http://www.scipy.org][SciPy]]

** Getting Started
*** Prerequisites
FITSTemplate uses the =setuptools= build system for installation. In the (unlikely) event your python installation doesn't include setuptools, install it with
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
pip install setuptools
#+END_EXAMPLE

In the even more unlikely case that your python installation is also missing =pip=, first install that with
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py | python
#+END_EXAMPLE

and then install =setuptools= as above.

*** Installation
Once =setuptools= is installed, you can download and install with
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
git clone https://github.com/tbrantseg/FITSTemplate.git
cd FITSTemplate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
#+END_EXAMPLE

The dependency libraries should be automatically installed.

** Brief usage
- Instantiate =FITSCore=.
- Call the appropriate template generation function, specifying the output file name.
